# Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems

I always wanted to get into functional programming and in the end i decided to go with Lisp, no particular reason other that I both like lists and code which is hard to read.

So after reading some tutorials about the quirks of functional programming, I searched for something more practical and stumbled upon the 99 Lisp Problems. I liked that idea and got to work!

I decided to solve these problems with these constraints:

- **Only use the 7 primitive operators** (*quote*, *atom*, *eq*, *car*, *cdr*, *cons*, *cond*), with the excpetion of *equal*. This is not beacuse I am some kind of crazy purist but beacuse by doing so I'm forced to think in *functional mode*.
- **Solve them using *my solution***. There are multiple ways to solve these problems, most of them will be better than mine I am sure. But because I'm doing this to improve myself, I'm not going to bother with using the most performant one, but instead compare it with mine to learn from my *"mistakes"*.

If you are looking for the original 99 lisp problems form which I started, you can find them [here](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html).
